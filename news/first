**Added:**

* ``first`` kwarg to ``combine_latest`` allowing users to re-order the pipeline
  as needed when using ``combine_latest``. This helps with jug handle like
  graphs where a source node is both part of both the incoming streams, by
  allowing the ``emit_on`` stream(s) to be computed later, permitting the
  buffers to be filled when ``emit_on`` emits.
